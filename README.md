# ouroboros
A small-sized cryptography module to handle RNG and primality verification.

In order to run the project, you might need to install `pip` if you do not have it.

```shell
make install-pip
```

With `pip` installed, installing `tabulate` is easy. We need `tabulate` in
order to visualize execution results.

```shell
make install-tabulate
```

A classic `make run` puts the project in its trails.
